This project started with the need to water my plants at home when I am on vacation. I bought first a system that included a water pump with a timer. That one with some water flow reducers helped to moisture the soil of the different sized plants for a few weeks. This kind of system must be installed at least a week before leaving your home in order to make sure that the right amount of water is filled into the pots. The water consumption of the plants is very different in summer and in winter time. At least here in the north of Germany. Thus, running such a system for long was no option, as it could not be adjusted easily over the period of time. On the other hand I didn't like to install the system and putting it back after holidays. There are irrigation systems out there that don't need electronics, see "Blumat", "Cotton Strips", "Irrigation Ball", etc. I don't have any experience with these. As I am interested in the moisture data and as I wanted to control the watering to prevent the building of mold I decided to go the "active" path: I need a soil moisture sensor connected to a microcontroller and a water pump to water my plants accordingly.
