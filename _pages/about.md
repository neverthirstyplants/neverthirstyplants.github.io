Hi, this blog is about building a plant irrigation system using a diy capacitive soil moisture sensor. I'll focus on my plants at home, as I don't have access to a garden and it's also making my live a lot easier to use an environment that is in my reach and control. 

My name is Mario. I am actually a software engineer spending my entire work life in automotive industry building car navigation systems and in recent years creating lidar perception software. 

But the question who waters my plants when I am not at home and pure curiosity in the details of how soil moisture can be measured let me start this project which is more related to electronics. 

The structure of this blog will be:
 
 * Motivation and related work
   * Types of sensors and their costs
   * Available Sensors
   * Theory of capacitive sensors
   * Frequency/Soil/Temperature/Salt dependency
   * Advantages/Disadvantages
   * Related Work and Papers
 * Building and testing prototypes
   * Frequency counting vs Peak detector
 * Building a 20 MHz capacitive soil moisture sensor
 * Building a 120 MHz capacitive soil moisture sensor
 * Evaluating the differences of a 20 MHz and a 120 MHz
 * Connecting a Pump
 * Online Data and Remote Control
 * Possible Applications and Further Development
