Hi, this blog is about building a plant irrigation system using a diy capacitive soil moisture sensor. As I don't have access to a garden, and to make my live easier, I'll focus on my plants at home. 

My name is Mario. I am ... 

The question who waters the plants when I am not at home and pure curiosity in the details of how soil moisture can me measured let me start this project. 

The structure of this blog is:
 
 * Motivation and related work
   * Types of sensors and their costs
   * Available Sensors
   * Theory of capacitive sensors
   * Frequency/Soil/Temperature/Salt dependency
   * Advantages Disadvantages
   * Related Papers
 * Building and testing prototypes
   * Frequency counting vs Peak detector
 * Building a 20 MHz capacitive soil moisture sensor
 * Building a 120 MHz capacitive soil moisture sensor
 * Evaluating the differences of a 20 MHz and a 120 MHz
 * Connecting a Pump
 * Online Data and Remote Control
 * Possible Applications and Further Development
